# The Amherstburg Courier

by Katharine Ball

_The Amherstburg Courier_ was a politically conservative newspaper founded by James Augustus Reeves on March 10th, 1849. He was the publisher, owner, and original editor. That same Spring, he fell seriously ill with consumption. His childhood friend, Charles Sangster, who later became a well-known poet, took over the editorship from June 1st onwards (see Nov. 24th, p. 2). Some of his writings, e.g. _The Sniffleton's_, were included in the newspaper.

_The Amherstburg Courier_ was a 6 column, 4 page newspaper, published every Saturday, from an office on Dalhousie Street, opposite the British North American Hotel. It was "devoted to news, literature, agriculture, miscellaneous intelligence, and amusement". It cost 10 to 15 shillings per annum, depending on the method of payment and delivery. However, "all kinds of produce or cord wood [were] taken in exchange for the paper, at the market price".
 
James Augustus Reeves was born on April 4th, 1820 in Quebec City and spent most of his childhood in Kingston. There, he apprenticed as a printer with the newspaper, _The Kingston Chronicle And Gazette_. During the Rebellion of 1837-1838, he served his country as a volunteer and was believed to be present at the Yonge Street affair in Toronto (_The Canadian Album: Men of Canada_, vol. 2, page 276). From about 1839-1849, he resided in Sandwich, where he was employed as the foreman in the office of the newspaper, the _Western Standard_. He then moved to Amherstburg to found the _Amherstburg Courier_. Unfortunately, he died in Sandwich on October 4th, 1849, only 7 months after the newspaper's debut. Shortly afterwards, Charles Sangster resigned as editor and moved back to Kingston. On page 2 of the November 24th, 1849 issue, his successor, I. B. Boyle, wrote:

>The policy of this paper will remain unchanged. The leading doctrines of the great Conservative, or British American, party will receive a hearty support, while the ruinous and degrading measures of the present Rebel Rewarding Government will meet at our hands that treatment they so richly merit…

In later years, Charles Wiggins, John Richmond, and Colin Fox were also editors. _The Amherstburg Courier_ likely ceased about 1854.
